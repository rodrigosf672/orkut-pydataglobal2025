::: notes
Gauge audience familiarity.  
Mention that Orkut shaped Brazilian online culture long before Facebook.
:::

---

## Introduction

- Orkut shaped early Brazilian internet culture.  
- Community names were a public form of self-curation.  
- After 2014, almost all platform data disappeared.  
- Only partial HTML snapshots survive.

::: notes
Set up the problem: cultural loss + fragmented archives + why reconstruction is valuable.

## Why Orkut Matters

- Communities worked as a vocabulary of identity.  
- No algorithmic feeds: users curated themselves.  
- Names acted as expressive micro-texts.

::: notes
Explain how community titles functioned like early status updates, humor, belonging cues.

::: notes
Situate Orkut’s decline within Doctorow’s broader analysis of platform incentives.  
Emphasize that this pattern is structural: growth → extraction → collapse.  
Use this as a bridge to why so much cultural material vanished and why reconstruction matters.
:::

---

## Platform Decline

- 51M+ communities lost.  
- Almost all cultural material erased.  
- Remaining content = inconsistent web snapshots.

::: notes
Emphasize digital amnesia and importance of recovery.
:::

---

## Orkut Archive in the Wayback Machine {.fullbleed}
![](images/orkut-wayback.png)

::: notes
Highlight how inconsistent and incomplete the archive is.  
Motivates reconstruction work.
:::

---

## What Survives

- 124,988 recoverable community names.  
- Variation across language, style, humor, identity cues.  
- Each title = a micro-text of early social networking.

::: {.callout-important}
Clusters represent linguistic similarity; not user groups.
:::

::: notes
Clarify what the dataset actually is and isn’t.  
Prevent misinterpretation: this is linguistic, not social network analysis.
:::

---

## Reconstruction Challenges

- No API  
- Broken/partial HTML  
- Layout varies by year  
- Missing pagination  
- Duplicate and inconsistent content

::: notes
Summarize scraping complexity; justify defensive parsing choices.
:::

---

## Reconstruction Approach

- Multiple CSS fallbacks  
- Defensive parsing  
- Deduplication  
- Noise filtering  
- Stored as CSV for reproducibility

::: notes
Reassure reproducibility.  
Highlight careful engineering despite messy source data.
:::

---

## Linguistic Foundations

- Community names encode stance, identity, humor, belonging.  
- They form a unique record of early internet culture.  
- Analysis combines stylometry and semantics.

::: notes
Explain why stylometry + semantics complement each other.
:::

---

## Stylometric Features

- Character length:  
  "eu te amo" → "eu te amooooo"

- Caps ratio:
  "EU TE AMO" vs. "Eu te amo"

- Vowel elongation:  
  "nooossa"

- Punctuation elongation:
  "vem!!!" / "oi????"

- Symbol density: 
  "♥ eu te amo ♥"

- Miguxês (k_style):
  "aki, keru, naum"

::: notes
Keep examples intuitive.  
Emphasize expressive registers and internet-era writing styles.
:::

---

## Semantic Features

- Multilingual embeddings (SentenceTransformers)  
- UMAP projection  
- KMeans / HDBSCAN / BERTopic clustering

::: notes
Explain pipeline: embeddings capture meaning, UMAP shows structure, clustering identifies thematic groups.

## Preview of Analyses

In the interactive Quarto report, I’ll walk through:

- Language distribution  
- Semantic space (UMAP)  
- Stylometry (caps-lock, Miguxês)  
- Topic modeling with BERTopic  
- Sentiment structure  

These plots reveal structure, style, and expressive patterns across community names.

::: notes
Set expectations: slides show static previews; real exploration happens in the QMD report.
:::

## Language Distribution {.fullbleed}

_static preview — interactive version shown in the Quarto report_

::: notes
Mention mix of Portuguese, English, Spanish, and smaller languages.
:::

## Semantic Map (UMAP) {.fullbleed}

_static preview — interactive exploration in the Quarto report_

::: notes
Axes aren’t interpretable; emphasis is local neighborhoods.
:::

---

## Caps Lock Stylometry {.fullbleed}
![](images/plot3.png)

_static preview — deeper inspection in the Quarto report_

::: notes
Use caps ratio as a proxy for emotional intensity or stylistic emphasis.
:::

## Miguxês Stylometry {.fullbleed}

_static preview — full analysis in the Quarto report_

::: notes
Explain Miguxês as a youth-coded register.
:::

## BERTopic: Micro-topic Barcharts {.fullbleed}

_static preview — interactive version in the Quarto report_

::: notes
Highlight intuitive topics: affection, fandom, jokes, identity.
:::

## BERTopic: Intertopic Distance Map {.fullbleed}
![](images/plot6.png)

_static preview — interactive exploration in the Quarto report_

::: notes
Interpret topic families and proximity.
:::

---

## Sentiment Mapping {.fullbleed}
![](images/plot10.png)

_static preview — interactive version in the Quarto report_

::: notes
Explain VADER limitations for Portuguese.
:::

---

## Sentiment Interpretation

- Portuguese positive expressions are formulaic → cluster tightly  
- Negative expressions vary syntactically → disperse  
- VADER used cautiously (English model)

::: notes
Acknowledge limitations but highlight patterns.
:::

---

## Recap of Analytical Findings

- Languages reflect Orkut’s cultural geography  
- Semantic space shows clusters of humor, affect, fandom, locality  
- Stylometry captures expressive registers  
- BERTopic reveals micro-topics  
- Sentiment patterns shaped by formulaic vs. varied expressions  

Full interactive walkthrough is available in the Quarto report (`orkut_analysis.qmd`).

::: notes
High-level summary before moving to implications.
:::

---

## Conclusion

- Orkut preserves a unique moment in online identity-making.  
- Communities were a lightweight identity system.  
- Expressive registers include humor, affect, locality, fandom, youth styles.  
- Computational methods reconstruct lost cultural landscapes.

::: notes
End with cultural significance + methodological contribution.
:::

---

## Why This Matters

- Platforms vanish; cultural memory disappears.  
- Surviving fragments still hold sociological value.  
- Orkut shows intentional, user-driven identity: no algorithmic mediation.

::: notes
Connect to broader debates on digital memory and platform governance.
:::

---

## Future Directions

- Richer sociolinguistic modeling  
- Geographic identity signals  
- Register mapping across semantic space  
- Archival forum thread analysis  
- Multi-feature alignment (semantics × style × sentiment)

::: notes
Encourage collaboration; mention potential for community-based archival projects.
