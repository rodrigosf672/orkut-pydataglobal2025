    "text": "7.2 Miguxês Distribution\nMiguxês is a playful, youth-oriented online writing style that became widespread in Brazil during the early 2000s and was especially visible on Orkut. It uses deliberate spelling changes, including the replacement of qu with k, to signal informality, intimacy, and membership in specific online peer cultures.\nThe miguxês map colors each point using a binary indicator (k_style) that marks names where the letter k appears in positions where standard Portuguese uses qu, as in kerer or kasa. Clear English words such as rock or link were filtered out so that the feature would more reliably capture Portuguese stylistic play. This indicator captures only one dimension of miguxês and should be understood as a narrow and approximate proxy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodological note on k_style\n\n\n\nThe k_style feature is a narrow heuristic meant to approximate one aspect of miguxês. It carries a high risk of false positives because many languages and proper nouns use the letter “k” naturally. It should therefore be treated only as a coarse stylistic proxy, not a reliable classifier of miguxês.\n\n\nEven with this limited feature, the map shows localized clusters of stylistically marked names rather than a uniform distribution. These clusters often fall in semantic neighborhoods associated with youth-oriented or playful communities, which aligns with sociolinguistic descriptions of miguxês as a register tied to online peer groups.\nThe overall pattern suggests that orthographic style participated in the same latent structure as topic, sentiment, and language. Spelling choices were one of the ways Orkut users signaled identity and social alignment in public.\n\n\nCode\nfig2 = px.scatter(\n    df, x=\"x\", y=\"y\", color=\"k_style\",\n    title=\"Miguxês Distribution Map\",\n    color_continuous_scale=[\"lightgray\",\"crimson\"],\n    opacity=0.5\n)\nfig2.show()"

    "section": "8.1 BERTopic Visualizations",
    "text": "8.1 BERTopic Visualizations\nThe BERTopic model identifies recurring patterns in how Orkut users named their communities. These topics are not communities of people but clusters of titles that share similar lexical and semantic properties. They help reveal the cultural motifs, expressive habits, and identity markers that shaped the platform’s public vocabulary. The following subsections introduce the main diagnostic plots used to interpret these patterns and discuss what they suggest about the structure of Orkut’s naming conventions.\n\n8.1.1 Topic Barcharts (Top 20)\nThe charts below display the highest-scoring words for the twenty most prominent BERTopic micro-communities. Each topic represents a dense lexical neighborhood in embedding space. These are not “real” communities in the sociological sense but statistical clusters formed from surface cues in community names. Their value lies in revealing the recurring motifs through which Orkut users signaled identity, affinity, and humor.\n\n\nCode\nfig_barchart = topic_model.visualize_barchart(top_n_topics=20)\nfig_barchart.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nIn aggregate, these twenty topics illustrate the semantic texture of Orkut’s community names. They suggest that self-presentation was shaped by nationality, affect, fandom, kinship, humor, and everyday evaluations. Because the analysis operates only on community titles, these clusters should be read as patterns of linguistic association rather than strict categories of online social life.\n\n\n8.1.2 Intertopic Distance Map\nThe intertopic distance map projects all micro-topics into a two-dimensional embedding space. Each circle represents a topic, and circle size corresponds to its relative frequency. Topics that appear close together share similar semantic environments. Topics that appear far apart occupy distinct regions of the expressive landscape. The map shows that the naming practices on Orkut formed several clusters of related meanings rather than a single homogeneous field. It also reflects the high granularity of the model, since hundreds of micro-topics coexist within a relatively dense space.\n\n\nCode\nfig_topics = topic_model.visualize_topics()\nfig_topics.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Hierarchical Clustering\nThe dendrogram arranges topics into a hierarchical structure based on similarity. Although visually extensive, it provides a valuable multi-scale view of the landscape. Small micro-topics join into medium clusters, and medium clusters join into larger families. This structure shows that users relied on a repertoire of related naming styles that blend into one another at higher levels of abstraction. The dendrogram should not be interpreted as a taxonomy of social categories. Instead it helps reveal how diverse micro-styles combine to form broader semantic regions.\n\n\nCode\nfig_hier = topic_model.visualize_hierarchy()\nfig_hier.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\n\n8.1.4 Term Score Decline by Topic\nThe term-score decline plot shows how sharply c-TF-IDF values fall within each topic. For most topics, the top-ranked word is far more distinctive than the words that follow. This pattern indicates that many topics have a narrow lexical core that strongly defines them. A minority of topics display flatter curves, suggesting more heterogeneous naming patterns. The overall impression is that Orkut community names often relied on formulaic and highly concentrated lexical signals. Users did not draw from an unlimited vocabulary but instead repeated familiar patterns that the model can easily detect.\n\n\nCode\nfig_rank = topic_model.visualize_term_rank([0])\nfig_rank.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\n\n8.1.5 Similarity Matrix\nThe similarity matrix compares the twenty largest topics and displays cosine similarity among their embeddings. Darker squares correspond to higher similarity. Clusters associated with affection vocabulary appear near each other. Clusters that emphasize national identity or family categories also align closely. In contrast, topics tied to early internet slang, rock music, fan scenes, or personal names occupy more distant positions. This matrix supports the interpretation that Orkut naming practices were structured by a small number of expressive families rather than a random assortment of unrelated phrases.\n\n\nCode\nfig_heat = topic_model.visualize_heatmap(top_n_topics=20)\nfig_heat.show()"
